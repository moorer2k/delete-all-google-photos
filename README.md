This is a simple script to delete all of your google photos quickly. I know others exist, however, they seem to have bugs or are a bit out dated, so here is a simplified, fast, and working script.

-> Load the photos.google.com URL with the proper user selected. THIS IS IMPORTANT!!

-> Paste this into the console and watch it work. 


NOTE: Tested on brave.
